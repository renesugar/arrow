Memory and IO Interfaces
========================

This section will introduce you to the major concepts in PyArrow's memory
management and IO systems:

* Buffers
* File-like and stream-like objects
* Memory pools

pyarrow.Buffer
--------------

The :class:`~pyarrow.Buffer` object wraps the C++ ``arrow::Buffer`` type and is
the primary tool for memory management in Apache Arrow in C++. It permits
higher-level array classes to safely interact with memory which they may or may
not own. ``arrow::Buffer`` can be zero-copy sliced to permit Buffers to cheaply
reference other Buffers, while preserving memory lifetime and clean
parent-child relationships.

There are many implementations of ``arrow::Buffer``, but they all provide a
standard interface: a data pointer and length. This is similar to Python's
built-in `buffer protocol` and ``memoryview`` objects.

A :class:`~pyarrow.Buffer` can be created from any Python object which
implements the buffer protocol. Let's consider a bytes object:

.. ipython:: python

   import pyarrow as pa

   data = b'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
   buf = pa.py_buffer(data)
   buf
   buf.size

Creating a Buffer in this way does not allocate any memory; it is a zero-copy
view on the memory exported from the ``data`` bytes object.

The Buffer's ``to_pybytes`` method can convert to a Python byte string:

.. ipython:: python

   buf.to_pybytes()

Buffers can be used in circumstances where a Python buffer or memoryview is
required, and such conversions are also zero-copy:

.. ipython:: python

   memoryview(buf)

.. _io.native_file:

Native Files
------------

The Arrow C++ libraries have several abstract interfaces for different kinds of
IO objects:

* Read-only streams
* Read-only files supporting random access
* Write-only streams
* Write-only files supporting random access
* File supporting reads, writes, and random access

In the interest of making these objects behave more like Python's built-in
``file`` objects, we have defined a :class:`~pyarrow.NativeFile` base class
which is intended to mimic Python files and able to be used in functions where
a Python file (such as ``file`` or ``BytesIO``) is expected.

:class:`~pyarrow.NativeFile` has some important features which make it
preferable to using Python files with PyArrow where possible:

* Other Arrow classes can access the internal C++ IO objects natively, and do
  not need to acquire the Python GIL
* Native C++ IO may be able to do zero-copy IO, such as with memory maps

There are several kinds of :class:`~pyarrow.NativeFile` options available:

* :class:`~pyarrow.OSFile`, a native file that uses your operating system's
  file descriptors
* :class:`~pyarrow.MemoryMappedFile`, for reading (zero-copy) and writing with
  memory maps
* :class:`~pyarrow.BufferReader`, for reading :class:`~pyarrow.Buffer` objects
  as a file
* :class:`~pyarrow.BufferOutputStream`, for writing data in-memory, producing a
  Buffer at the end
* :class:`~pyarrow.HdfsFile`, for reading and writing data to the Hadoop Filesystem
* :class:`~pyarrow.PythonFile`, for interfacing with Python file objects in C++

We will discuss these in the following sections after explaining memory pools.

Memory Pools
------------

All memory allocations and deallocations (like ``malloc`` and ``free`` in C)
are tracked in an instance of ``arrow::MemoryPool``. This means that we can
then precisely track amount of memory that has been allocated:

.. ipython:: python

   pa.total_allocated_bytes()

PyArrow uses a default built-in memory pool, but in the future there may be
additional memory pools (and subpools) to choose from. Let's consider an
``BufferOutputStream``, which is like a ``BytesIO``:

.. ipython:: python

   stream = pa.BufferOutputStream()
   stream.write(b'foo')
   pa.total_allocated_bytes()
   for i in range(1024): stream.write(b'foo')
   pa.total_allocated_bytes()

The default allocator requests memory in a minimum increment of 64 bytes. If
the stream is garbaged-collected, all of the memory is freed:

.. ipython:: python

   stream = None
   pa.total_allocated_bytes()

On-Disk and Memory Mapped Files
-------------------------------

PyArrow includes two ways to interact with data on disk: standard operating
system-level file APIs, and memory-mapped files. In regular Python we can
write:

.. ipython:: python

   with open('example.dat', 'wb') as f:
       f.write(b'some example data')

Using pyarrow's :class:`~pyarrow.OSFile` class, you can write:

.. ipython:: python

   with pa.OSFile('example2.dat', 'wb') as f:
       f.write(b'some example data')

For reading files, you can use ``OSFile`` or
:class:`~pyarrow.MemoryMappedFile`. The difference between these is that
:class:`~pyarrow.OSFile` allocates new memory on each read, like Python file
objects. In reads from memory maps, the library constructs a buffer referencing
the mapped memory without any memory allocation or copying:

.. ipython:: python

   file_obj = pa.OSFile('example.dat')
   mmap = pa.memory_map('example.dat')
   file_obj.read(4)
   mmap.read(4)

The ``read`` method implements the standard Python file ``read`` API. To read
into Arrow Buffer objects, use ``read_buffer``:

.. ipython:: python

   mmap.seek(0)
   buf = mmap.read_buffer(4)
   print(buf)
   buf.to_pybytes()

Many tools in PyArrow, particular the Apache Parquet interface and the file and
stream messaging tools, are more efficient when used with these ``NativeFile``
types than with normal Python file objects.

.. ipython:: python
   :suppress:

   buf = mmap = file_obj = None
   !rm example.dat
   !rm example2.dat

In-Memory Reading and Writing
-----------------------------

To assist with serialization and deserialization of in-memory data, we have
file interfaces that can read and write to Arrow Buffers.

.. ipython:: python

   writer = pa.BufferOutputStream()
   writer.write(b'hello, friends')

   buf = writer.getvalue()
   buf
   buf.size
   reader = pa.BufferReader(buf)
   reader.seek(7)
   reader.read(7)

These have similar semantics to Python's built-in ``io.BytesIO``.
